# CAA Project | Turn DNA into Art

In this project we made a program which converts a DNA sequence into an image. The image is built out of blocks and will form a square where each box represents a nucleotide. The program allows the user to paste in a DNA sequence and then select the size of the boxes. Next the program will ask the used to assign colours to each nucleotide (A, T, C, G) using a color picker. After all nucleotides have been assigned a colour the program will start drawing the visualisation of the DNA sequence. When this drawing is done you can take a screenshot of the generated image to save the picture, or you can close the program and start over again. Selecting the same colours each time allows for clear visualisation of variations between two DNA sequences.

To use the program first download Python 3.8. Next download the DNAintoArtinator.py file from this repository. You can then double click on the .py file to start the program. The .mp4 file named Demonstration gives a clear explenation on how to use the program and can be downloaded from this repository as well.
